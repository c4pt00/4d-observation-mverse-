# 4d-observation-mverse-


changes in the past that affect this timeline or not slightly 

are not measurable from inside the 4th dimension of this known universe only from the mutli dimensional realm of the 5th dimension where this universe branches into multiverse of different 4th dimensional time arrows starting from almost infinite amounts of big bang events each one being a slightly different version of our cosmic big bang event as a starring point of this known 4th dimensional reality 



so if time and space changes the earthly cosmic realm it can't be a scientific measurement as an observational measurement from within inside of this known 4th dimension itself only from the 5th dimensional realm
